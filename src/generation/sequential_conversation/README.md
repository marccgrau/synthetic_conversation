# LLM-filtered Customer Service Conversations Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains simulated conversations generated by our agentic simulation system.
The conversations are filtered by a LLM to ensure they are of high quality.
Each record is stored in JSON Lines (JSONL) format and includes:
- **Input Settings:** Metadata such as selected bank, customer, agent profiles, and task details.
- **Messages:** The full conversation messages.
- **Summary:** A German summary of the conversation.
- **Cost Information:** API cost metrics for the conversation simulation.

## Intended Use
The dataset is designed for analysis of customer service interactions and as training data for conversational agents.
Users should note that the dataset is synthetically generated and may exhibit biases based on the simulation parameters.

## Potential Biases and Limitations
While efforts were made to simulate realistic interactions, the conversations are generated based on predefined scenarios and random sampling.
Users should exercise caution when using this dataset for real-world applications and be aware of potential biases introduced during simulation.

## Additional Information
