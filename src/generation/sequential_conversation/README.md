# Simulated Aggressive Customer Service Conversations Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains **aggressive** customer service conversations generated by an agentic simulation system.
Each record is stored in JSON Lines (JSONL) format and includes:
- **Scenario Metadata:** Selected bank, customer, agent profiles, and task details.
- **Conversation Messages:** Full message history between the customer and service agent.
- **Summary:** A German summary of the conversation.
- **Cost Metrics:** API cost tracking for the conversation simulation.

## Intended Use
The dataset is designed for:
- Training AI models to handle **aggressive customer interactions** in financial services.
- Studying **customer frustration and escalation patterns** in banking and insurance.
- Developing improved **de-escalation detection** in customer service AI.

## Potential Biases and Limitations
- Conversations are synthetically generated and may exhibit biases from predefined scenarios.
- Aggressiveness is simulated and might not fully reflect real-world customer behavior.
- The dataset does not include **real customer interactions**â€”it is meant for simulation-based research.
